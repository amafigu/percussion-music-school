The project, presented by Fernanda Gigliani, Popular Initiative, was unanimously approved by the rest of the councilors of the legislative body. The President of the Municipal Council, María Eugenia Schmuck, addressed the venue: “It is a pleasure that the venue is filled with art, we are very proud of this distinction since we have a city that is a breeding ground for great musicians, artists and educators. Not just anyone, no matter how good they are in their discipline, can teach, only those who can transform knowledge into empathy can do so, generating a construction space where everyone grows, which is why the feat that we are distinguishing today is admirable and exemplary.`;
